This repo is still a work in progress.

Everything is designed for platformIO and might possibly depend upon
the Atom IDE

### Configuration ###

Check your serial port assignment when you connect your device. If the
auto-detect doesn't work, then edit platformio.ini and manually specify
the serial port to use.

### Note ###
This was developed for the esp8266 chip mounted on the Warcollar custom
carrier. Other boards and chipsets may work.
